### General usage tips

The app displays impact projections for a given year, or a given temperature increase value, at one of three spatial aggregation levels (City, Country, Region). These options are given by the **"By"** and **"Spatial domain"** toggles.

Change the content of the boxes surrounding the map and rank table to change what is displayed in the respective widgets.

If **"By Period"** is selected, the values on the slider represent the year matching the projections being shown. Similarly, by selecting **"By Temperature Increase"** we can see the projections associated with a specific temperature increase.

With "All" selected we will see a map of points. If the **"Country"** box and the **"Age group"**" box display "All", then we will see results for all the cities in all the countries, and for all the age groups added together.

With the **"Temperature impact"** box we can choose to show the mortality attributed to heat and/or cold.

Please have a look at the **Glossary** for information on the impact measures and scenarios.

#### Map tips

The layer button in the top-right controls the basemap tiles and by extension the names of the cities and countries shown.
