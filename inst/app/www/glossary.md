### *Impact measures*

**Attributable Number / Excess deaths**: Represents the estimated annual number of deaths related to temperature in a given period.

**Attributable fraction**: Represents the annual proportion of deaths attributed to temperature in a given period.

**Excess death rates**: Represents the annual proportion of inhabitants that could die because of temperature in a given period. Expressed as a number of deaths attributed to temperature per 100,000 persons.

### *Scenarios*

**SSP**: [Shared Socioeconomic Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)
**RCP**: [Representative Concentration Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway)

**SSP1-RCP2.6**: In the SSP1 scenario, the world shifts towards a more sustainable path, reducing inequalities and investing more in health and education. Coupled with RCP 2.6, this represents a low greenhouse gases emission scenario that would reach net zero around 2075. In this scenario, warming would be expected to remain below 1.8°C. Population growth in Europe is higher in SSP1 than in SSP3 and baseline mortality rates are lower.

**SSP2-RCP4.5**: The SSP2 scenario represents a world in which the socioeconomic and technological trend remain consistent with the historical ones. This is coupled with RCP4.5, representing a moderate greenhouse gases emission scenario in which emissions start decreasing the second half of the century without ever reaching net zero. Under this scenario, warming would likely be above 2°C and could even exceed 3°C.

**SSP3-RCP7.0**: The SSP3 scenario assumes an increase in regional rivalries, a resurgence of nationalism and a low priority given to environmental concerns. Coupled with RCP7.0, this corresponds to a high greenhouse gas emission scenario in which emissions would double by the end of the century. Under this scenario, global warming would likely exceed 3.5°C at the end of the century.
