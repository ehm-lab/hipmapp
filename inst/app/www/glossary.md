### *Impact measures*

**Attributable Number / Excess deaths**: Represents the estimated annual number of deaths related to temperature in a given period.

**Attributable fraction**: Represents the annual proportion of deaths attributed to temperature in a given period.

**Excess death rates**: Represents the annual proportion of inhabitants that could die because of temperature in a given period. Expressed as a number of deaths attributed to temperature per 100,000 persons.

### *Scenarios*

**SSP**: [Shared Socioeconomic Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)\
**RCP**: [Representative Concentration Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway)

**SSP1-RCP2.6**: In the SSP1 scenario, the world shifts towards a more sustainable path, reducing inequalities and investing more in health and education. Coupled with RCP 2.6, this represents a low greenhouse gases emission scenario that would reach net zero around 2075. In this scenario, warming would be expected to remain below 1.8째C. Population growth in Europe is higher in SSP1 than in SSP3 and baseline mortality rates are lower.

**SSP2-RCP4.5**: The SSP2 scenario represents a world in which the socioeconomic and technological trend remain consistent with the historical ones. This is coupled with RCP4.5, representing a moderate greenhouse gases emission scenario in which emissions start decreasing the second half of the century without ever reaching net zero. Under this scenario, warming would likely be above 2째C and could even exceed 3째C.

**SSP3-RCP7.0**: The SSP3 scenario assumes an increase in regional rivalries, a resurgence of nationalism and a low priority given to environmental concerns. Coupled with RCP7.0, this corresponds to a high greenhouse gas emission scenario in which emissions would double by the end of the century. Under this scenario, global warming would likely exceed 3.5째C at the end of the century.
