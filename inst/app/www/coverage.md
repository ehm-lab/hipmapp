### Coverage

The list of cities corresponds to the cities featured in the Urban Audit dataset of Eurostat at the time of extraction. 
The Urban Audit features 870 cities from 30 countries (EU-27, with the addition of Norway, Switzerland and the UK), corresponding to cities for which the Local Authority Unit (LAU) exceeds 50,000 inhabitants. 
In the analysis, we discarded overseas cities from France, Spain and Portugal, as well as Reykjavik (Iceland) given the very different climates compared to mainland Europe. 
This leaves a sample of 854 cities.

Results are reported for 5-year periods from 2015 to 2099 according to three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP): SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP3-RCP7.0. 
We also report results for three levels of global warming: 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C above pre-industrial levels. These warming levels are reported in the context of scenario SSP3-RCP7.0, being the one of the three for which climate models reach each of these warming levels.
