### Methodology

Projected excess deaths due to climate change rely on exposure-response functions previously estimated for all cities described above (openly shared on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10288665)). 
These functions indicate, for a specific temperature, what is the expected increase in mortality.

To estimate future excess deaths we retrieved projections of daily temperature for all cities from 19 General Circulation Models from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections database, and projections of population and death rates for the 30 countries from the Wittgenstein Centre Human Capital Data Explorer. These projections were extracted for the period and scenarios described above.

For each SSP-RCP scenario, we projected annual excess deaths using a standard attribution methodology, then computed rates from projected population figures. 
Two **sub-scenarios** were considered: one in which we consider changes of both temperature and demographics (**Historical + Demographic or demo**), and one in which the distribution of temperature is kept constant across the century (**Full**). 
The difference between these two scenarios (**Climate change or full-demo**) provides an estimation of heat and cold-related deaths that can be attributed to climate change.
